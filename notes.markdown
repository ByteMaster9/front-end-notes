To all you clueless BE trolls having no idea about what a modern day front end involves, allow me to cure your ignorance today. This is what goes in mastering modern day front-end:-

1. Client side vs Server side rendering
2. Ensuring the bundle size does not go out of bounds
3. Ensuring your code works in all screen sizes from mobile to web to tv sometimes
4. Ensuring the web vitals metrics are in an acceptable range else there is a direct impact on revenue because consumers have zero patience for slow websites
5. Knowing the nuances of the front end framework you are using, else you will end up writing shitty code doing too much re-rendering at the expense of memory usage in browser shooting up.
5. Ensuring code is performant even on a slow network. Lazy loading, dynamic imports, prefetching, browser cache, local storage, session storage, service workers etc are all fair game here
6. Ensuring people have something to see on your app/website in offline mode
7. Ensuring your app/website is accessible for vision/hearing impaired.
8. Micro-frontends just like how you have your micro-services.
9. Trade-offs of build time vs run-time asset loading
10. Mastery over the build tools to compile, minify and build assets.

And all this is just a subset of what we do.
